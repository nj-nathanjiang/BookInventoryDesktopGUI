# BookInventoryDesktopGUI
This is my Book Inventory Desktop GUI app, made with Python. In the examples folder, you can find example simple Python Tkinter apps.

To make an application, you can pip install pyinstaller, then on the command line, you can write

### pyinstaller --onefile --windowed frontend.py

in the project directory.
